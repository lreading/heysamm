# HeySamm!
An enterprise-ready OWASP SAMM web interface.  These are early days, but I'm working on it!

Sammwise was archived recently, and I really liked having a web interface for the OWASP SAMM project/tooling.  This project aims to reintroduce a web interface, but with a focus on it being "enterprise ready".  This will definitely be done iteratively, so don't hope for anything complete just yet! =]

## Mission
Provide an enterprise-ready web interface for the OWASP SAMM project to allow more organizations to adopt and use the SAMM model.

## Goals (in no particular order)
These are the lofty goals I have as of the start of this project:
- [ ] Web interface for conducting assessments
- [ ] Visualization of assessments
- [ ] AuthN via SSO/OAuth
- [ ] Multi-organization/department/team support (terminilogy TBD)
- [ ] Executive Summaries / Reporting
- [ ] Compare assessments over time
- [ ] Compare orgs/departments/teams
- [ ] Integration with other tools (JIRA, other things?)
